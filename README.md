# Instagram Realtime and FBNS
This library is heavily based on the [PHP implementation](https://github.com/valga/fbns-react).
It integrates with the [instagram-private-api](https://github.com/dilame/instagram-private-api).

# Getting started

1. Run ```npm install Nerixyz/instagram_mqtt```
2. Import the library `import { FbnsClient, RealtimeClient } from 'instagram_mqtt';`
 (with require: `const {FbnsClient, RealtimeClient) = require('instagram_mqtt')`)
3. Login to Instagram
4. [Use](examples) the clients.
